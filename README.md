[Live DEMO](https://rennacarver.github.io/KnowNative-welcome-modal/)

## Features

- Modal dialog welcomes the user to Knownative
- Allows selection of starter text

## How It's Made

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This prototype was later implemented in React and merged into the main Knownative codebase.

## Lessons Learned/Future Enhancements

- Styling radio buttons requires quite a bit of CSS
- Modal dialogs should use a single dialog element to enable CSS transitions
- CSS transitions don't work with max-height properties and auto values
